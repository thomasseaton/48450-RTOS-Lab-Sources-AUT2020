fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process, referred to as the child, is an exact duplicate of the calling process.

On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child. On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, in which case, no child process is created, and errno is set appropriately.
